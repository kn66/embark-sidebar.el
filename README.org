* Overview

=embark-sidebar= provides a dynamic sidebar for Emacs that displays recent commands and completions using Embark Collect functionality. Unlike traditional static sidebars, this creates a value-driven sidebar that prioritizes recently used items, enhancing productivity through intelligent command history integration.

* Motivation

This package was created to address several limitations of existing sidebar solutions:

- **Static Nature of Existing Tools**: While =treemacs=, =neotree=, and =imenu-list= offer excellent UI and usability, they serve limited, specific purposes and often remain unused as mere decorations
- **Value of Recent History**: Tools like =savehist= and =prescient= demonstrate that history-based sorting significantly improves productivity, with recent commands having higher practical value
- **Dynamic Sidebar Concept**: By combining =embark-collect= with recent command history, we can create a sidebar that dynamically shows the most valuable and relevant information

The result is a sidebar that adapts to your workflow, always showing the most pertinent commands and completions.

* Features

- **Dynamic Content**: Automatically populates with recent commands and completions
- **Embark Integration**: Leverages Embark's powerful action system
- **Vertico Integration**: Collect sidebar automatically when exiting Vertico and for allowed commands
- **Performance Optimized**: Only collects if candidate count is within set threshold
- **Customizable Display**: Adjustable sidebar width, side (left/right), and buffer name
- **Global Minor Mode**: Enable or disable sidebar and integration via =embark-sidebar-mode=
